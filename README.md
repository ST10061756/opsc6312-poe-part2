We integrated geoapify api into the tourist app by utilizing its geocoding services to convert addresses into geographic coordinates. I used the geoapify geocoding api to fetch latitude and longitude coordinates for various tourist attractions and landmarks. I also implemented reverse geocoding to provide users with human-readable addresses for specific coordinates. Additionally, I used the autocomplete feature to provide users with address suggestions as they search for locations. This allowed users to easily find and explore new places.
